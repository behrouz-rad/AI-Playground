  This is the code review from AI.

### Filename: global.json
- The SDK version has been updated from `8.0.401` to `8.0.402`.
  - **Purpose:** Updating the SDK version might be necessary for new features, bug fixes, or security patches that are available in the newer version. Ensure compatibility with other tools and libraries used by your application.
  - **Improvement:** Consider setting a specific roll-forward policy to control how the SDK should handle updates automatically.
  - **Best Practice:** Follow guidelines from official documentation when updating SDK versions, especially for major or minor upgrades. Use semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch) to manage dependencies better.
  - **Issue:** No clear issues mentioned.

### Filename: src/TestProject.Console/Calculate.cs
- A new file named `Calculate.cs` has been added.
  - **Purpose:** This likely introduces a utility class for performing mathematical calculations, specifically the sum operation in this case.
  - **Improvement:** Include proper comments explaining the purpose and functionality of the methods within the file. Consider adding more complex calculation functions if needed.
  - **Best Practice:** Follow established naming conventions (e.g., PascalCase for class names) to improve readability and maintainability. Use namespaces correctly by defining them with a `namespace TestProject.Console;` directive at the top of the file.
  - **Issue:** File lacks typical header comments and detailed method documentation, which can affect understandability for other developers or in future maintenance phases.

### Filename: src/TestProject.Console/Models/RegistrationOptions.cs
- The `RetryCount` property value has been changed from `5` to `8`.
  - **Purpose:** Adjusting the retry count might be necessary if network conditions have changed, or for better performance under certain load conditions. This could also reflect a change in testing parameters.
  - **Improvement:** Consider making this configurable via environment variables or configuration files rather than hardcoding these values.
  - **Best Practice:** Use constants or configuration settings (like appSettings) to manage such adjustable properties, which promotes easier modification and avoids hardcoding 'magic numbers' into the codebase.
  - **Issue:** Potential over-optimization without empirical evidence might lead to wasted resources in scenarios where lower retries would suffice.

### Filename: src/TestProject.Console/TestProject.Console.csproj
- Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience package with version `8.9.1` has been added, while the Polly reference and its version have been removed.
  - **Purpose:** Adding resilience support via a different library (`Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience`) might be to enhance HTTP request handling capabilities such as retries or circuit breaking, potentially improving application reliability under transient failures.
  - **Improvement:** Ensure that the new package aligns with other dependency versions and updates documentation if necessary. Consider deprecating deprecated functionalities (like Polly).
  - **Best Practice:** Use stable versions of libraries to ensure compatibility and minimize potential risks from updating a library which could affect large parts of your applicationâ€™s behavior.
  - **Issue:** Updating dependencies might involve testing in staging environments before production deployment, especially if there are significant behavioral changes between versions.
