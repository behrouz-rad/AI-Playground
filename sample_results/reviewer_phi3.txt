 This is the code review from AI:

- global.json (File)
    - Change added sdk "version", which seems to be an update specific version change that can potentially bring new features or security updates compared to the previous one (8.0.401 -> 8.0.402). Reviewing documentation for significant changes and understanding their impact on your codebase is advised before proceeding with this upgrade, ensuring compatibility throughout your project files using MSBuild Reference Behavior (.NET Core projects handle SDK version differences via a reference behavior file usually named 'global.json').
- Calculate.cs (File)
    - A new C# class was added as internal called "Calculate" with only one method `Sum()`. As currently written, the changes suggest we have an update function that sums two integers and returns them. There is no other functionality or context needed since it's a simple static utility class—so keep in mind to maintain its simplicity while considering performance optimizations if used extensively for calculations within complex projects due to method call overhead costs with large arrays of numbers, potentially implementing parallel processing strategies where appropriate can be considered here.
- RegistrationOptions.cs (File)
    - The RetryCount was updated from 5 to 8 in the default constructor setting and is marked as 'required' property for a new instance, this will help prevent unintended errors caused by not providing values during object creation, hence good validation mechanisms should be encouraged throughout your code. However one potential concern might arise: How does application flow affect system resources or user experience with increasing retries? If RetryCount can lead to excessive resource usage without correspondingly significant fail conditions/errors then further considerations on back-off strategies, circuit breaker implementations for maintaining responsiveness are advised.
    - Additionally note the reference of a new library "Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience" at project level which seems related to providing fault tolerance mechanisms and resilient HTTP client operations using Polly extension methods; review documentation carefully on this, as well understanding implementation details ensures consistent end-to-end reliability within your application’s interaction with external services/APIS especially where robust error handling is required under varying network conditions or API stability.
    - Check for any other library dependencies that were changed in tandem to ensure compatibility and security standards are upheld during the entire migration process, paying extra attention when using NuGet package restore methods without specifying necessary versions explicitly might introduce unexpected changes into older projects with potential runtime errors/incompatibilities due to conflicting DLL references.
- TestProject.Console.csproj (File)
    - Changed from "Polly" version 8.4.1 in the test project file, which has been replaced by a more recent package 'Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience', this implies new resilience and HTTP client features are likely involved; thorough investigation into these updates might be required to ensure proper error handling/retry mechanics for network failures within web service access in your codebase, which should align with the overall project's exception management strategy including logging (trace or console), avoiding common pitfalls like infinite looping on transient timeout errors.
    - Note FluentResults package upgraded to version 3.16 is also mentioned at dependency level this third-party library specializing in JSON serialization/deserialization along with fluent APIs can provide a readable and maintainable approach for complex data mapping or conditional logic application across various facets of the project but ensure testing against your specific use scenarios as it doesn't necessarily replace native methods like Newtonsoft.Json due to its own syntax semantics – this choice would likely affect code consistency/mobility if other team members are not accustomed with FluentResults style or have compatibility issues in older runtimes, thus ensuring that testing and transitional strategies are planned accordingly for smoother migrations without disruption within the development lifecycle.
