 This is the code review from AI:

1. **global.json**
	* Change in "version": Updated SDK version from 8.0.401 to 8.0.402.
		+ Purpose: The update might include new features, bug fixes, or compatibility adjustments. Ensure that this version bump was tested and is required for the project's dependencies.
		+ Potential Improvements: Consider automatic updates if applicable rather than manual changes to keep up with SDK updates in the future.
		+ Best Practices: Keep track of change logs or release notes for SDK versions to understand what has changed.
2. **src/TestProject.Console/Calculate.cs**
	* New File: Added a static method `Sum` to calculate the sum of two integers.
		+ Purpose: Adding utility functions can be helpful for common operations like addition, especially if they are used frequently throughout the application.
		+ Potential Improvements: If summing is an operation required by multiple classes, consider encapsulating it in a more general-purpose math utilities class.
		+ Best Practices: Ensure that the method's naming and functionality clearly communicate its purpose. Implement unit tests for this new functionality.
3. **src/TestProject.Console/Models/RegistrationOptions.cs**
	* Change in "RetryCount": Increased the default value from 5 to 8.
		+ Purpose: This change might indicate that the application now needs more retries or error tolerance, which could be due to environment changes or a requirement to handle increased load or failures.
		+ Potential Improvements: Consider making this configuration adjustable via an external source or command-line argument to avoid hardcoding values directly into the codebase.
		+ Best Practices: If the change is significant (e.g., 100% increase), document this decision in the commit message or the application's documentation.
4. **src/TestProject.Console/TestProject.Console.csproj**
	* Change in PackageReference "Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience": Added a new package reference for resilience.
		+ Purpose: Implementing resilient HTTP requests can make client applications more robust by handling failures and retries automatically.
		+ Potential Improvements: Ensure that other related changes, such as updates to how clients are configured or used in the application, are also made accordingly.
		+ Best Practices: Verify that the new package is compatible with other project dependencies and that it provides benefits worth the additional library size.
