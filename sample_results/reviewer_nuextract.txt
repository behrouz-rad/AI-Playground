  This is the code review from AI:

- global.json
  - The version field has been changed to "8.0.402". It represents a new minor version, which may include minor changes and features improvements as compared to previously specified versions like "8.0.401" in the original file. Ensure that this change aligns with your project's release management process.

- src/TestProject.Console/Calculate.cs
  - A new file has been created (new file mode 100644) and includes an improved namespace convention using PascalCase for class names, which is a best practice in C# coding style. However, there is no explicit context given at this point; make sure to provide necessary comments or methods.

- src/TestProject.Console/Models/RegistrationOptions.cs
  - The RetryCount property has been changed from "5" to "8", which may be a result of the decision to accommodate more retries if needed during registration attempts. Justification for this change should be documented, ensuring consistency with overall project requirements and architecture.

- src/TestProject.Console/BuildFileConfigurations.csproj
  - There has been an addition of the "Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience" package version "8.9.1", presumably to add resilience features to HttpClient. It's important to test this integration thoroughly and consider if further refactoring might be necessary for your project context, while being careful about dependency management to avoid unwanted bloating of the framework with each new feature addition.

- src/TestProject.Console/BuildFileConfigurations.csproj
  - The "Polly" package version has been removed ("8.4.1") from the package references. Polly provides advanced resilience and fault tolerance techniques, which might have influenced this decision; be sure to analyze if other parts of the project are depending on it for their functionality before removing dependencies altogether. Check whether there's a plan to replace its features with those provided by "Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience" or another equivalent library, as appropriate.

These reviews have been made with an emphasis on ensuring code compatibility, maintaining best practices, observing version management strategies, and staying up-to-date with modern C# conventions. Always consider potential impacts of these changes within your specific project requirements.
