  This is the code review from AI:

### File "global.json" 
This file defines global settings for version of the .NET SDK used in the project, and whether SDK will roll forward to a newer major release when it finds that another version would run the project on its own. The file has been updated from version '8.0.401' (in the original code) to '8.0.402'. This change might not affect the direct behavior of your program, but with each new major .NET version there will be breaking changes, so it is a good idea to keep an updated version number just in case something does need updating.

### File "Calculate.cs" 
This is a new file created in project. It appears that the previous 'global.json' change forced creation of this new file. This new .cs file could have been made by a certain update or refactoring operation, where a new class has been added to this project. Usually new classes are added when more functionality is needed throughout the application. However, without knowing the specific changes and functions being implemented within these files, it's tough to give a thorough explanation about what exactly this new file does.

### File "RegistrationOptions.cs" 
In this updated class, an additional property 'HttpClient' is added to track an HTTP client for the purpose of making requests to service registry address specified as a part of 'RegistrationRequest'. This update may add more functionality around handling request to service or it might be related to resiliency for handling potential failures.

### File "TestProject.Console.csproj" 
Here, more specific versions (8.*) are used for certain package references in the project file. This is typically done when migrating code to new versions of .NET Libraries or packages, especially when they have introduced breaking changes. Also, the Polly package has been removed, and you might want to consider keeping it if your project heavily uses retries or error handling. Keeping updated libraries will enable your project for better future resilience against issues related to network, services etc.
