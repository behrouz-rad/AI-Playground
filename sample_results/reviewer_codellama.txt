  This is the code review from AI. Here are my comments on each file:

global.json:
* The change to increase the SDK version to 8.0.402 and set "rollForward" to "disable" may be useful for some users if they want to disable the automatic roll-forward of the SDK version. However, this is not a critical change as the latest version is already being used by default.
* The change to increase the SDK version to 8.0.402 is not a significant change and can safely be ignored.

src/TestProject.Console/Calculate.cs:
* This file has been added, but it is not obvious why this was necessary since the functionality already exists in another file. Consider removing this file or explain its purpose.

src/TestProject.Console/Models/RegistrationOptions.cs:
* The change to increase the "RetryCount" property from 5 to 8 may be useful for some users if they want to increase the number of retries in their code. However, this is not a critical change as the default value is still 5.
* The change to add an `HttpClient` instance to the class can improve performance since it allows the SDK to share a single HTTP client across multiple requests. Consider removing this property if it is not necessary for your use case.

src/TestProject.Console/TestProject.Console.csproj:
* The addition of the "Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience" package can improve performance since it provides resilient HTTP request handling functionality. However, this may not be a critical change as the SDK provides similar functionality already out-of-the-box. Consider removing this package if it is not necessary for your use case.
